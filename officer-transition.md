## Things to Keep in Mind

Keep in mind that you may interact with confidential information through the course of your duties. You're expected to use good judgement in maintaining the confidentiality of this information, abiding by any applicable University rules and regulations, and obeying any laws and legal obligation that you may be under.

For legal reasons, I'm required to disclose the following:

 - Your use of Google Apps accounts are governed by Google's [Terms of Service](https://www.google.com/policies/terms/).
 - Yes, everything under TexasAPO.org is logged by Google and can be audited.
 - We will respond to legitimate request for information by the Texas APO Ombudsman, The University of Texas at Austin, and/or law enforcement.

Bottomline: **please don't do anything stupid or illegal**.

## Google Apps

Google Apps is at the heart of what keeps Texas APO a well-oiled machine. Google Apps is essentially the same as Gmail, Google Drive, etc., except this is all done under the TexasAPO.org domain. You also have a TexasAPO.org account and email address.

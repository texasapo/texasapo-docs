# Editor's Guide to TexasAPO.org

Thank you for your interest in becoming an editor and author on TexasAPO.org.

## Account Guidelines
Each account, and any content that you write/publish, is tied to **you and your name personally**, not your branch or officer position. *Therefore, each person should have his/her own account and not share accounts.*

## Basic Process
Here's the main process for creating a new post:
* Login at https://www.texasapo.org/wp-admin (once you have your account).
* **Posts** > **Add New**.
* Set the **Title** and **Category [important!]** (in the lower right-hand side). Be sure to uncheck **Uncategorized** and select an appropriate category.
* Repeat until satisfied:
  * Write and revise the content
  * Preview the post
* Publish the post.

## Style guidelines
Here are some specific guidelines to keep things consistant across posts:
 * Remember that you're representing the organization, so be careful with content and language of your posts. *Everything is definitely public and will likely be indexed by Google.*
 * **Headers** (titles and subtitles): use style **Header 5**.
 * **Images**: Resize your JPG to 2048px @ 72ppi on the long edge with a quality of 50%. *Be very careful with images in Wordpress, as they'll usually display in their uploaded resolution.* This could lead to really large images being displayed for no real benefit. **If you're not sure what this meant, talk to the Webmaster or a RHOtographer before uploading any images.**
 * Use the ````Save Draft```` and ````Preview```` features before publishing!


### Using the Wordpress Visual Editor

For the most part, you'll be using the [Wordpress Visual Editor](https://en.support.wordpress.com/visual-editor/). It's the easiest and seems to work well for almost all use cases. If you need to do something fancy, like split-column layouts, then see **Using the SiteOrigin Page Builder**.

### Using the SiteOrigin Page Builder

This lets you do some fancy things, but it requires learning how Page Builder works. See this [video](https://vimeo.com/114529361). Here are additional guidelines that we'll use:
 * For any rows that you add, be sure to eliminate the spacing:
   * **Gear Icon** > **Edit Row** > **Theme** > Set **Top/bottom padding** to **0px** > **Save**.
